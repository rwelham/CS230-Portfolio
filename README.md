# CS230-Portfolio

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Romm client wanted a system recommendation for a multiserver game called Draw-It or Lose-It.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a good job of explaining the requirements of each system and the pros and cons of the different platforms.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It really put into perspective how every piece of making a program is really important.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my final recommendations just because I feel like there's a lot more research that can be done with choosing what kinds of platforms work best.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I was able to update the document based on the client's desired abilities for the program and to try and keep things within a reasonable budget.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I just approached it by doing a little bit at a time consistently.
